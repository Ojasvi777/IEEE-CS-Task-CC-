Overview
This repository contains three C++ programs implementing different data structures and algorithms:

Cache with Expiry – A time-based key-value cache that automatically removes expired entries.
Interval Merger – Merges overlapping intervals dynamically.
Stack with Min/Max – A custom stack supporting push, pop, top, getMin(), and getMax().
Compilation & Execution
Use the following command to compile any of the C++ files:
-  g++ filename.cpp -o output
-  ./output

Descriptions
1. Cache with Expiry
Stores key-value pairs with an expiry time.
Automatically removes expired keys when accessed.
Uses a priority queue to manage expiry.
2. Interval Merger
Adds intervals dynamically while merging overlapping ones.
Uses a sorted approach to maintain merged intervals efficiently.
3. Stack with Min/Max
Supports push, pop, and top.
Efficiently retrieves the minimum and maximum values in constant time.

Requirements:
C++ compiler.
Basic knowledge of C++ and data structures.
