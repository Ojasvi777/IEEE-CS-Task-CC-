# 📌 Data Structures & Algorithms in C++  

## 📖 Overview  
This repository contains three C++ programs implementing different data structures and algorithms:  

### ✅ **1. Cache with Expiry**  
A time-based key-value cache that automatically removes expired entries.  

### ✅ **2. Interval Merger**  
Dynamically merges overlapping intervals while maintaining efficiency.  

### ✅ **3. Stack with Min/Max**  
A custom stack supporting:  
- `push()`, `pop()`, `top()`  
- `getMin()` – Retrieves the minimum element in constant time.  
- `getMax()` – Retrieves the maximum element in constant time.

## ⚙️ Compilation & Execution  
Run the following commands to compile and execute any of the C++ files:  

```sh
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
```

## 🔍 Descriptions  

### 🚀 **1. Cache with Expiry**  
✅ Stores key-value pairs with an expiry time.  
✅ Automatically removes expired keys when accessed.  
✅ Uses a **priority queue** to manage expiry efficiently.  

### 🚀 **2. Interval Merger**  
✅ Dynamically adds and merges overlapping intervals.  
✅ Uses a **sorted approach** to maintain merged intervals efficiently.  

### 🚀 **3. Stack with Min/Max**  
✅ Supports `push()`, `pop()`, and `top()`.  
✅ Retrieves the **minimum** and **maximum** elements in **O(1) time**.
